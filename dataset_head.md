Name: get_all_players\nDescription: Fetches the id, name, and country of all players from the Valorant esports API based on the provided filtering criteria.\nParameters: {"minrounds": {"description": "Minimum rounds a player has to have played.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "timespan": {"description": "Time span to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "map": {"description": "Map to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "event": {"description": "Event to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "agent": {"description": "Agent to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "minrating": {"description": "Minimum rating to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "region": {"description": "Region to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "country": {"description": "Country to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "event_series": {"description": "Event series to filter players.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "limit": {"description": "Limit the number of players returned.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}, "page": {"description": "Page number for paginated results.", "type": "str, optional", "default": ""}}\n3.

You must always include the `<think>` field to outline your reasoning. Provide at least one of `<tool_call>` or `<response>`. Decide whether to use `<tool_call>` (possibly multiple times), `<response>`, or both.\n2. You can invoke multiple tool calls simultaneously in the `<tool_call>` fields. Each tool call should be a JSON object with a "name" field and an "parameters" field containing a dictionary of parameters. If no parameters are needed, leave the "parameters" field an empty dictionary.\n3. Refer to the previous dialogue records in the history, including the user\'s queries, previous `<tool_call>`, `<response>`, and any tool feedback noted as `<obs>` (if exists).', 'output': '<think> I should use the appropriate tool with proper parameters to respond to the user\'s need. </think>\n<tool_call>\n{"name": "get_all_players", "parameters": {"minrounds": "25", "minrating": "1200", "country": "United States"}}\n</tool_call>', 'split': 'train'}
